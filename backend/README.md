# 📦 @template-auth/backend

The authentication backend requires **Go 1.25.2 or newer**, a local disk for 
temporary files, and a **PostgreSQL** instance to initialize properly.

# 🧪 Debugging / Testing
Running `go test ./...` currently requires a live PostgreSQL instance, as
no mocks have been implemented for the database service yet.

Additional debug commands are available below for development and testing. 
They override the default startup flow and perform a single operation before
exiting:

- `debug_database_apply_schema`  
  Applies the embedded database schema.  
  Additional configuration for production use is required regarding user 
  authentication and versioning.

- `debug_email_render_template`  
  Renders embedded email templates using dummy literals into the `dist` directory.  
  Useful for previewing and customizing email templates.

# ➕ Contributing
This project was originally developed for personal use, so most features I 
personally needed are already implemented.

However, contributions are still welcome in the following areas:

- **Bug Fixes**  
  Although testing catches most logical issues, occasionally an edge case may 
  be found. Contributions that fix overlooked issues are appreciated! 

- **Service Providers**  
  Contributions that expand the list of supported email, rate-limit, storage, 
  and logging providers are welcome.  
  Please note that I aim to keep dependencies minimal, so try to keep 
  implementations as lean as possible.

- **Optimizations**  
  Improvements to database queries, memory usage, and startup time are all
  appreciated.

- **Extended Customization**  
  Many values have been hardcoded for personal preference.  
  If you need a custom value, consider modifying the `util_configuration.go` 
  file, setting the default to the original value for compatibility.

# 🔰 Codebase Overview
The project is organized into several packages, each handling a specific layer 
of the backend. This section gives a quick rundown of what lives where.

# 🆙 Running Locally

The server can be started locally with `go run main.go` but will crash unless 
the environment variable `DATABASE_URL` points to an active database with the 
schema applied.
